## 2026-02-03T22:14:19.878Z - US-001
- Created a TypeScript greeting function that accepts a name parameter and returns a personalized greeting message. The function is properly typed and exported for use in other modules.
- Files changed: greeting.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Simple user stories with clear acceptance criteria are straightforward to implement
  - TypeScript type annotations improve code clarity and safety
  - Export keyword makes the function available for module imports
  - Documentation comments enhance code maintainability

## 2026-02-03T22:15:01.225Z - US-002
- Created a greeting function that includes the current timestamp in ISO 8601 format. The function uses new Date().toISOString() to generate a consistent, current timestamp that is appended to the greeting message.
- Files changed: greeting.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Using toISOString() ensures consistent ISO 8601 timestamp format across all JavaScript runtimes
  - The greeting function was implemented as a pure function with no dependencies, making it easy to test and maintain
  - Since no existing codebase was present, a new TypeScript file was created with proper documentation
